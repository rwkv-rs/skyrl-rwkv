"""SkyRL's receive-side weight-transfer engines (the inference-worker half).

vLLM's NCCL and IPC engines, subclassed to add two things that hang off the
same seam: the engines call ``self.model.load_weights(...)`` directly with no
callback, so the only injection point is the ``self.model`` handle they read.
That handle is whichever model the session targets -- the main model, or the
spec-decode drafter under ``/start_draft_weight_update``.

* **Checkpoint loading.** Split compact batched-MoE FP8 wire tensors from
  ordinary checkpoint weights before calling the target model's loader.
* **LoRA staging.** When the round has been armed with a LoRA receive target
  (``weight_sync/lora_target.py``), the stream is a PEFT adapter rather than the
  model: the tensors are staged for vLLM's LoRA manager instead of loaded, and
  the base model is not touched at all.

Registered (in ``weight_sync/register.py``) under ``skyrl_nccl`` / ``skyrl_ipc``
rather than shadowing vLLM's
``nccl`` / ``ipc``: ``register_engine`` raises on a duplicate name, and
``WeightTransferConfig.backend`` is typed ``Literal[...] | str`` and validated
against the registry, so a new name is all that is needed.
