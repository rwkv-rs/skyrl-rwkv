"""``WeightSource`` implementations over SkyRL's training backends.

A ``WeightSource`` is vLLM's trainer-side weight contract
(``vllm.distributed.weight_transfer.base``): ``metadata()`` and ``__iter__``,
which must agree element for element. Chunking is vLLM's: the packed producers
cut bounded-memory chunks out of a fixed buffer and consume the source lazily,
so a source's only obligation is to be a lazy generator that does not retain.

Sharded RDT needs two more channels (per-rank ownership under PP/EP, and a group
index) that vLLM has no concept of; they live in
``sharded_rdt/sharded_rdt_base.GroupedWeightSource``.

``LoraAdapterWeightSource`` streams a PEFT adapter instead of the model, for
adapter-only sync (Megatron ``merge_lora=false``) with
``lora.sync_mode=memory``. It is the one source that must be prepared before the
send: see its docstring.

Imports vLLM at module scope, so import this lazily from anything that must work
without the wheel.

    Subclasses implement :meth:`export_adapter_stream` (a collective on the

    :meth:`finalize_adapter`, which turns the retained unique tensors into the
    layout vLLM loads plus the ``adapter_config``. This class dedupes shared
    expert adapters as the stream arrives and publishes the ``receive_target``
    the worker extension forwards to the receivers.

    Dedupe happens on the stream, before finalize, because the exporter may
    materialize every public key: on GLM-5.3 that is 30.77 GB per rank against
    0.62 GB unique. ``finalize_adapter`` therefore only ever sees canonical
    keys. Alias groups are per (module, expert-group, lora_A|lora_B), so the
    ``lora_A`` sibling of a canonical ``lora_B`` is itself canonical and any
    per-key transform that pairs A with B still has both.

    Unlike the model sources, the export cannot be re-run per channel: the
    dedupe is what decides which keys exist, so ``metadata()`` and iteration
    must see one export. :meth:`prepare` runs it once, on every rank, and the
    caller must invoke it before ``send_weights()`` -- the ``receive_target``
    is only known afterwards and has to reach the workers first. Iteration
    drops the cache, so the next round re-exports.

    Retaining the unique adapter between the two channels is what the model
    sources avoid, and is affordable for exactly the same reason the dedupe
    exists: it is the deduplicated adapter, not the model.
